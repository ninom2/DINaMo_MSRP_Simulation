This simulator/library of files was made as a part of an ongoing effort by the DINaMo Lab of MIT 
in collaboration with various other universities to develop an algorithmic foundation for the 
deployment of Autonomous Air Cargo at Scale. 

The goal of this code was to create a semi-realistic simulation of the delivery of packages via
autonomous drones. The simulation does not have a flash GUI or bells and whistles, this is because
the focus of this effort was to find an optimal schedule for the drone's takeoff, delivery, return,
and charging. For this a GUI was not feasable to make in the short span of time given

This code was created over the span of two months from June-August 2022, and was edited slightly to
run more efficently during the months following. Mainly this is just an expos√© to show off the work I 
did at MIT over the summer of 2022
